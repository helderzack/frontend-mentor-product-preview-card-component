## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I consider myself a beginner frontend developer, but this project was useful for me to practice with some concepts I still struggle with, like positioning of elements and the use of flexbox in general. With that being said, , I believe I'm a better developer now, after the beginning of development of this project.

### Continued development

The project is not finished yet. I have work to do on the responsiveness of the site. Right now, the display of elements on small screens is appaling, so I have to work with media queries. Also, I need to host this website on some platform. When I'm done developing it, I'll attend to that.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This resource helped me with working with flexbox, espcially on the positioning of the elements. CSS Tricks is a really valuable resource with a so much CSS content. It's awesome.

- [Add Custom Fonts to Your Websites Using Google Fonts - HTML & CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgmLDPLApBY) - This video helped me on using the google fonts defined on the challenge. It's a simple process, but one I had absolutely no experience on, so this video helped me.
